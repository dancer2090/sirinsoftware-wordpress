					Efficient development and releasing current Mobile Apps to satisfy customers is becoming more important as mobile usage grows worldwide. Mobile has changed the way users interact with businesses and brands. <b>These days, businesses cannot directly replicate their desktop strategy on mobile.</b> Instead mobile app developers need to re-think how to build mobile experiences that are useful for clients in their moments of need.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Successful delivery of mobile apps isn’t only about tools, monitoring, or processes – it’s about creating resilient and reliable mobile apps by bringing the best practices learned from DevOps to mobile.</b> Efficient and timely delivery of features and functionality to customers is key.

					<p>
						The mobile experience continues to assert its dominance and is now bringing ever increasing revenues. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					For example, Facebook’s mobile ad revenue accounted for <span class="sel">82%</span> percent of all ad revenue in the first quarter of 2016, up from <span class="sel">73%</span> in Q1 of 2015. Both its daily and monthly mobile active user counts continued to climb. TechCrunch notes that <span class="sel">91%</span> <b>of Facebook’s massive user base now visits the platform on a mobile device, with <span class="sel">894</span> million “mobile-only” users.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Most mobile devices use one of the two dominant operating systems: Google-developed Android or the Apple-developed iOS. What about Blackberry and Windows phones? From an app developer’s point of view, their small declining market share means that there’s little need to consider them. The two main rivals, iOS and Android, both have grown considerably over the last few years.
				</p>

					</div>
					<p>
						The maturity and flexibility of android has surpassed ios in many ways. the gap between the two is fast diminishing as ux for both is on par with each other, while the number of apps in the two app stores is tilting in android’s favor.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b>2016 is going to be a challenging time for an iOS App developer.</b> Apple has moved from a single platform, Mac OS, to four platforms: iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Mac OS. What’s more, this comes in parallel with the introduction of a new language, Swift, and another deployment platform: Linux.

					<b>The Native approach is the most common way of writing an application.</b> This is a platform specific approach that requires a unique expertise developed with a native SDK. It requires quite a significant workload, because each platform requires writing code in a specific language. In the case of iOS app development, you have to know Objective-C. <b>Thus, producing the code for both an Android App and an iOS App literally doubles the amount of work to be done.</b>
				</p>
				<div class="pic-text">
					<div class="pic">
						<img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri();?>/img/img-02-08.png" alt="">
					</div>
					<p>
						The biggest advantage of native applications is their performance and functionality. native apps can be downloaded and installed from the app store unlike web applications. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b><span class="sel">Native</span> iOS and Android apps nowadays have become more complex and integrated with more network services.</b> Back-end API performance, global cellular data networks, and misbehaving third-party SDKs can all have a dramatic impact on overall application performance. Therefore, in the case of a native application, automated integration testing in a variety of environments is essential.

					<span class="sel">Web-based</span> applications are programs that load within a mobile browser, like Safari or Chrome, or any other mobile or nonmobile browser.

						Web apps are sometimes designed to look and behave like native mobile apps and are feasible solutions when the purpose is to make content or functionality available on mobile. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Originally <b>Facebook</b> deployed its mobile version using a web approach. As a result it was slower, and it had to run inside a mobile browser. In web apps, developers can work using <b>PHP, Angular JS, .Net, WordPress, HTML5, Kentico, Drupal, Javascript, MySQL, NoSQL, and SQL.</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The one big disadvantage mimicking a native app with a web app is that you won’t be able to run it offline.</b> The access to different kinds of hardware is also limited; basically different sensors on your phone that can make your app more interesting and functional. <b>Webs apps meant to mimic native apps cannot be downloaded and installed from the App Store.</b>

			<div class="descript">
				<p>
					<b><span class="sel">The Hybrid</span> approach has the best of both worlds.</b> Languages you have to learn to build native apps are quite a bit more difficult that the languages you have to learn for other approaches. With Hybrid Mobile App development you are using the same language as people are using to build websites.

					<p>
						With a hybrid app you have the same codebase for both android and ios platforms. you are making an app like a website, but actually having it run as a native app. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Software products like <b>Titanium, Sencha Touc, and PhoneGap/Cordova</b> provide services to cloud enable your application, and a wide array of network features, and data objects. Right after <b>HTML/CSS/JavaScript,</b> local files are designed and built as sort of a mobile app wrapping.

				<h2>Current Trends in&nbsp;Developing Mobile Apps</h2>

			<div class="descript">
				<p>
					Network services have become essential to the App experience, and application design patterns that accommodate network errors, authentication challenges, and other asynchronous data flows are essential tools for any app developer. What are the specific difficulties of developing a mobile application vs. web application? <b>For web apps there are concerns such as browser compatibility and different access patterns;</b> for example, things like being on a 3G and LTE that are really slow. <b>Developers have to make sure optimize speed for the inactivity of a network.</b>

					<p>
						A key consideration is enhancing the security of applications of both ios and android apps.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					A considerable amount of effort over the past few years has been put into introducing new features and APIs for dramatically improved runtime permission systems, transport encryption settings, Fingerprint APIs, as well as new data protection features for private and corporate users.
